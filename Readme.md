# Lab | Imbalanced data
## 1.Data cleaning 
We only have 3 independent variables which don't have null values so we can save all the filling nulls steps. 
## 2.Building a model 
### 2.1. Extracting the target and independent variables (and scaling them):
We first of all extract the target variable (The churn Variable). After, we extract the independent variables that we'll use for trying to predict the churn probability(tenure, SeniorCitizen, MonthlyCharge). For the these independent variables, we have to apply some scaling method

### 2.2. Testing our logistic regression model
